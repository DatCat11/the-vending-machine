# the-vending-machine
I started making this on my phone a couple days ago at school when I was bored.

This is my first project in Python, and it's a somewhat simple terminal game where the objective is to purchase all 500 items out of the vending machine.

You begin with 30 dollars, and after losing your entire budget, you must find money in other ways.

It's pretty easy albeit a little boring, and it shouldn't take you too long.
